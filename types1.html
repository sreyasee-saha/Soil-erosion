            <h1>Understanding the Different Types of Soil</h1>
            <p>Whether you’re a commercial farmer or hobbyist gardener, having a basic understanding of the different types of soil is crucial for ensuring your plants thrive.</p>
            <p>Soil can be categorized into many different types — each with its own characteristics, limitations, and benefits — but how many main categories there are depends on who you ask.</p>
            
            <h2>What Is Soil?</h2>
            <p>According to the Soil Science Society of America, soil is “the unconsolidated mineral or organic material on the immediate surface of the earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of land plants.”</p>
            <p>Soil is also formally defined as the surface matter that’s been subjected to environmental factors of climate, macro- and microorganisms, and relief conditioning.</p>
            <p>Top soil, by definition, is the upper, outermost layer of soil. As such, topsoil is usually the top 5 to 10 inches of surface dirt and is composed of organic matter, water, air, and mineral particles.</p>
            <p>Potting soil is a type of soil mixture of peat, loam, sand, and nutrients that help vegetables, herbs, fruit, and plants grow to their maximum potential.</p>
            <p>Soil performs seven critical functions in an ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil is a growth medium for plants.</li>
                <li>Soil modifies the atmosphere by absorbing and emitting gases and dust.</li>
                <li>Soil provides a habitat for animals and organisms.</li>
                <li>Soil holds, releases, absorbs, purifies, and alters the earth’s water.</li>
                <li>Soil processes recycled nutrients such as carbon.</li>
                <li>Soil acts as an engineering media for constructing roadbeds, foundations, buildings, dams, and other manmade structures.</li>
                <li>Soil serves as a living filter to clean water before it moves into an aquifer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
            <p>Soil can be categorized into three basic types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sand</li>
                <li>Silt</li>
                <li>Clay</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three types of soil are considered soil separates. They are divided by particle size with clay particles being the smallest and sand being the largest.</p>

            <h3>Textural Classes of Soil</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sand</li>
                <li>Loamy sand</li>
                <li>Sandy loam</li>
                <li>Sandy clay loam</li>
                <li>Sandy clay</li>
                <li>Loam</li>
                <li>Clay loam</li>
                <li>Clay</li>
                <li>Silty clay</li>
                <li>Silty clay loam</li>
                <li>Silt loam</li>
                <li>Silt</li>
            </ul>
